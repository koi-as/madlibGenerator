# Mad Lib Generator
### Designed by Koi

## Description
Python project to generate a silly short story using words provided by user.


## Installation and Usage

## Credits
I used a tutorial from Python Geeks found [here](https://pythongeeks.org/python-mad-libs-generator-project/). It walks through step by step how to code it, but double check your own work because there are points where the tutorial is incosistent with variable names. For example, they go from using "Screen" to define the window to "win".


Other than the tutorial, I put my own finsihing touches on this, so I also deserve a little credit! :)
