# Mad Lib Generator
### Designed by Koi

## Description
Python project to generate a silly short story using words provided by user.


## Installation and Usage
I actually DON'T want you to use this project. I don't think it's very good.


If you DO want to subject yourself to absent minded typing and generating the same broken sentences, here's how you can do that:


Note: This guide is for Windows operating system only


You will need to have python 3 installed on your local machine to run the program. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install
- After you have downloaded python and set it up, download the index.py file.

- From there, go to where you downloaded the file to and right click the file to open more options.

- Look for an option to "Copy as path" and select it.

- Once you have copied the path, go to the search bar and search for "Terminal". Open it.

- In your terminal, enter the command "py" in the terminal line. 

- Once you type in py, paste in the file location you copied earlier wtih Ctrl+V. Press enter to run the program

Usage
- Once the program is running, you will be able to play the guessing game! Enter your guess in the large box in the center.

- After entering your guess, click the button named "GUESS" close to the bottom of the application.

- You will see a hint on whether your number is higher or lower than the random number as well as how many guesses you have left.

- Once you are finished playing, you can press the x in the upper right corner of the application and close it down.


To replay the game, simply type in the py command with the file path and press enter again, and a new window will display.

## Credits
I used a tutorial from Python Geeks found [here](https://pythongeeks.org/python-mad-libs-generator-project/). It walks through step by step how to code it, but double check your own work because there are points where the tutorial is incosistent with variable names. For example, they go from using "Screen" to define the window to "win".


Other than the tutorial, I put my own finsihing touches on this, so I also deserve a little credit! :)
